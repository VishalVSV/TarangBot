The discord bot written for PSBB Millennium GBKM's cultural event Tarang.

## Features
### Automatic google forms registration integration.
The application polls a Google Sheets file that is linked to the registration form and receives all participant metadata automatically.
This means there is no pesky second registration needed on the Discord Server. The bot also automatically assigns roles to participants it recognizes automatically.

### The spectate command
The bot also provides a command to spectate events in the competition itself. The command matches the event name fuzzily so spelling mistakes do not matter.
Sometimes if the bot is confident it may offer a suggestion, replying with yes will move you to the event it thinks you wanted to go to.
